# i18n Localizations
Welcome to where PizzaTown stores its Translated Texts for the bot. If you'd like to help, please create a `fork` and start editing! Create a pull request once you've commited your changes to your fork! 

**Keys**
`%<letter>` = Where a value from the bot should be. Do not translate this value otherwise the bot will break. See examples from `"profile"` to see how Rocky has done it with the keys!

**Warning: This repository will always be constantly updating.** 

Thank you to everyone who helps!
